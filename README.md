# A conceptual playground for advanced and rethought java patterns

Here you can find conceptual approaches for different Java patterns. New patterns, as well as old ones rethought. All of this is experimental and possibly useless. But new castles are constantly being built and then destroyed in a sandpit.

## Requirements
The code is based on Java 8 (and higher), needs [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) to build and an installed [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/).

## Available Patterns

### Simple feature toggle

A simple feature toggle pattern to conditionally switch functionality on or off without coupling the condition and the feature to the main code.

### Visitor Factory

Visitor is a common gang of four (gof) pattern, which is rethought by coupling with a factory to reduce boilerplate code.
